## Features

1. **Trigonometric Calculator**:
   - Computes basic trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, tangent, as well as inverse functions like arcsine, arccosine, and arctangent.
   - Converts between degrees and radians.

2. **Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Plots interactive graphs for trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent) with adjustable parameters like amplitude, frequency, and phase.
   - Simulates projectile motion and visualizes the trajectory based on user input.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the required Python packages. You can do this using `pip`. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib termcolor
```
## Usage

### Trigonometric Calculator

- Choose option `[1]` from the main menu.
- Follow the prompts to select a trigonometric function and input the required values.

### Analysis and Visualization

- Choose option `[2]` from the main menu to open the interactive plot.
- Use the sliders to adjust amplitude, frequency, and phase to see how they affect the trigonometric functions.

### Projectile Motion Simulation

- Choose option `[3]` from the main menu.
- Enter the initial velocity and launch angle to visualize the projectile motion.

## Running the Script
